# Predicting-US-COVID-19-Hospitalizations-From-Trends-in-Google-Symptom-Searches
We use a US Google symptom search trends dataset and a US COVID-19 hospitalization cases dataset in order to compare how well K-Nearest Neighbour Regression and Decision Trees perform when predicting hospitalization cases from related symptom searches. We found that decision trees
produced significantly better predictions than K-Nearest Neighbour Regression in this problem.
